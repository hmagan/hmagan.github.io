# hmagan.github.io

Created as the product for my IB MYP Personal Project.
Designed to test and evaluate the user's working memory.

I am aware that the page is not responsive and does not work
properly on all devices and browsers that are not Chrome, 
however it is my first decent project so I will leave it uploaded :-)

That is something I will work on with later projects.
